# FDlib, shared library code for sub-modules of the FDQ package

Don't expect to find much in this file.

## v0.1.1

Add guards for assertion library to disable asserts in production

This also establishes the convention of saving a component's
subcomponents to a subdirectory of the same name. So if component
`foo.js`, saved to `src/foo.js`, has a subcomponent `bar.js`, that gets
saved to `src/foo/bar.js`.
